## Hello!
Welcome to Calan's Old R6 Mania, this took too long, I was bored and was banned from R6 for 24 hours so this just helped me lock in.
You can mostly ignore the first two collapsed sections but you will need to setup the VPN otherwise we cant play with each other (>Ï‰< )

## R6 Downloader Setup {collapsible="true"}
Calan will inform you what version to play. In most cases it's available on the CDN that he has setup
with R6 Downloads (Calan will supply the link when it happens), but if not here's what to do:

<procedure title="Setting up R6 Downloader" id="settingupr6downloader">
    <step>
        <a href="https://r6downloads.b-cdn.net/R6Downloader_V3_5.exe">Download R6 Downloader</a>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Press <shortcut>Arrows</shortcut> and <shortcut>Enter</shortcut> to navigate the menu.</p>

    </step>
</procedure>

## Downloading From the CDN {collapsible="true"}

<procedure title="Now it's CDN time! (Super Easy Method)" id="cdnlinkproc">
    <step>
        <a href="Empty-MD-Topic.md">CDN Links!</a>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Press <shortcut>Arrows</shortcut> and <shortcut>Enter</shortcut> to navigate the menu.</p>
<img src="https://images.guns.lol/igvH5.png" alt="completion suggestions for procedure" border-effect="line"/>
    </step>
</procedure>

## Setting Up Multiplayer
Because the servers for the old versions are no longer online you have to create local customs. No issue though
as you can use a VPN to Calan's Computer to make it seem like you are on the same network to R6 Siege

<procedure title="Setting up Radmin VPN" id="vpnsetup">
    <step>
        <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com">Download RadminVPN</a>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Open Radmin VPN and skip through the creation wizard, whatever you type it doesn't matter.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>The following is what Radmin VPN should look like once installed and opened.</p>
<img src="https://images.guns.lol/yGwkn.png" alt="completion suggestions for procedure" border-effect="line"/>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Press <shortcut>Network</shortcut> and then on <shortcut>Join Network</shortcut> to open the server finding menu it should look like the following.</p>
<img src="https://images.guns.lol/A3mo5.png" alt="completion suggestions for procedure" border-effect="line"/>
<p> You now need to type in the following credentials to the <shortcut>Private Network</shortcut> area</p>

<code-block lang="gitignore">
    Network name: Calan's Old R6 Mania
    Password: 4THGROUPONTOP!
</code-block>
    </step>
</procedure>

## Remember to run RainbowSix.bat and not RainbowSix.exe! Otherwise, the Anti Cheat will prevent the VPN usage!
